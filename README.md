### Abstract
In this work, we investigate modifications to Sznajd's model of opinion dynamics in two dimensions. Namely, we observe the effect of social media campaigns on the process of opinion formation in a population of voters. Our results suggest that increasing the influence of social media decreases the minimum threshold of initial opinion density required to achieve a phase transition. After crossing a certain probability of media influence, only one opinion will always prevail. We observe by how much is this effect reversed on adding an opposing media campaign. Further, we simulate two variants of the Sznajd's model to observe the effect of a voter choosing a certain side when there is conflict in his neighbourhood. The phase transition in the community's overall opinion is no longer observed and there is no clear majority for most values of initial opinion density.
